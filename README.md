jr-crop
======

A simple ionic plugin to crop your images, inspired by whatsapp and telegram.
* Specifiy width and height of target
* Doesn't actually scale the image, only returns a cropped version. Since the quality of images while scaling is inconsistent it's up to the developper to implement this, preferably on the server.
* Returns a canvas element with the new cropped image.

## Simple enough, let's get started.

Install the files: `bower install jr-crop --save`.

Import the static files jr-crop.js and jr-crop.css. Declare jrCrop as a dependency.
```
.module('myModule', ['ionic', 'jrCrop'])
```
Inject jr-crop.
```
.controller('MyController', function($jrCrop) {
```

Call the crop function to open a new modal where the user can crop this image. Pass in the image url and targetsize. The function will return a promise that resolves when the user is done or fails when the user cancels.
```
$jrCrop.crop({
    url: url,
    width: 200,
    height: 200
}).then(function(canvas) {
    // success!
    var image = canvas.toDataURL();
}, function() {
    // User canceled or couldn't load image.
});
```

##### Changing the title
Additionally you can add a title in the footer.
```
$jrCrop.crop({
    url: url,
    width: 200,
    height: 200,
    title: 'Move and Scale'
});
```

##### Circle mask
Add circle:true to the options to overlay the image with a circle. Note: it won't actually crop the image with a circle, just the visual representation.
```
$jrCrop.crop({
    url: url,
    circle: true
});
```

##### Changing default options.
Overwriting default options can be done as well.  
`$jrCrop.defaultOptions.template = '<div>...</div>';`  
`$jrCrop.defaultOptions.width = 300;`  
`$jrCrop.defaultOptions.circle = true;`

#### Templates

##### Custom templates
The template can be overwritten by passing your custom HTML in the options.
```
$jrCrop.crop({
    url: url,
    width: 200,
    height: 200,
    template: '<div>...</div>'
});
```

##### Interpolation Markup
If you configured the expressions of interpolated strings, you can apply this to the template by replacing the markup with your custom markup.
```
$jrCrop.defaultOptions.template = $jrCrop.defaultOptions.template
    .replace(/{{/g, '<%')
    .replace(/}}/g, '%>');
```

## Examples please!!
I got ya. Run `bower install && npm install && npm test` and visit `localhost:8181`. Great, now you can visit this from your phone too. It works best when packaged in cordova, as how you should use ionic anyway.

## Support
Though I'm only supporting iOS, I did get reports that it's working well on Android. If it doesn't, feel free to fork and update my codebase. If you just want to leave your thoughts you can reply in the [ionic forum topic](http://forum.ionicframework.com/t/sharing-my-photo-crop-plugin/4961).
